# Choraz Engine
Choraz engine, an upcomming engine written fully in C++ and C, that takes a modern technology approach supporting latest technologies like DirectX 11 and 12, Vulkan, OpenGL for Mobile and more!<br>
Additionally you can both script and compile in our own language Chorz for quick prototyping and production level speed and visually develop your games with ease using ChorzBlocks.

**We're planning to support:**
- Zig lang
- C++
- C#
- Rust
And on top of that languages like Python for simple scripting and fast prototyping.

# Our goal
Making a modern feature packed engine that fits in recent times while being light weight and modular for everyone to extend and to easily maintain.<br>
